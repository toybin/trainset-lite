# Development Project Interview

*Use this in addition to base.md for software development projects*

## Technical Stack

**Programming language(s):**
[Primary and secondary languages]

**Framework(s)/libraries:**
[Major frameworks, key dependencies]

**Development tools:**
[Editor/IDE, build tools, package managers]

**Testing approach:**
[ ] Unit tests required
[ ] Integration tests needed
[ ] Manual testing only
[ ] TDD/test-first discipline
[ ] No formal testing

**Code quality tools:**
[Linters, formatters, static analysis tools]

---

## Development Environment

**Local development:**
[How to run locally, dependencies, setup requirements]

**Version control:**
[Git workflow, branching strategy, review process]

**CI/CD:**
[Build pipeline, deployment process, environments]

**Database/storage:**
[Database type, migrations, data requirements]

---

## Architecture Decisions

**Application type:**
[ ] Web application (frontend/backend)
[ ] CLI tool
[ ] Library/package
[ ] Mobile app
[ ] Desktop application
[ ] Microservice
[ ] Other: ___________

**Key architectural decisions to make:**
[API design, data flow, security model, scalability needs]

**Integration requirements:**
[External APIs, third-party services, existing systems]

**Performance requirements:**
[Speed, scalability, resource constraints]

## Development Process

**Coding approach:**
[ ] TDD (test-driven development)
[ ] Design-first, then implement
[ ] Iterative prototyping
[ ] Copy-adapt-improve from examples
[ ] Exploratory/experimental

**How much do you want to code vs. have AI code?**
[ ] I write most code, AI helps when stuck
[ ] AI writes tests, I write implementation
[ ] AI writes first draft, I review/refactor
[ ] AI handles boilerplate, I focus on logic
[ ] AI does most coding, I guide and review

**Review process:**
[ ] Self-review only
[ ] Peer review required
[ ] Automated review (linting/testing)
[ ] No formal review

**Documentation needs:**
[ ] Inline comments only
[ ] README with setup instructions
[ ] API documentation
[ ] Architecture documentation
[ ] User guides

## Common Commands

**Test command:**
`[e.g., npm test, go test ./..., pytest]`

**Lint/format command:**
`[e.g., eslint ., golangci-lint run, ruff check]`

**Build command:**
`[e.g., npm run build, go build, python -m build]`

**Run/start command:**
`[e.g., npm start, go run main.go, python app.py]`

**Other important commands:**
[Deploy, migrate, seed data, etc.]
