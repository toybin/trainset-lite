- `commands/` - Command templates (copy to `.opencode/command/` or `.claude/commands/`)
  - `system/` - Trainset system commands (status, advance, gate-check, context, setup)
  - `project/` - Project-specific command templates (test, lint, build)
- `scripts/` - Bash helper scripts (optional but recommended)
  - `status.sh` - Extract phase/progress (for `/status` command)
  - `validate-gate.sh` - Check gate readiness (for `/gate-check` command)
  - `advance-phase.sh` - Orchestrate advancement (for `/advance` command)
  - `extract-context.sh` - Extract context (for `/context` command)
  - `create-workflow.sh` - Generate WORKFLOW.md scaffold (for `/setup` command)
  - `create-context.sh` - Generate CONTEXT.md scaffold (for `/setup` command)
  - `create-progress.sh` - Generate PROGRESS.md scaffold (for `/setup` command)
  - `list-phases.sh`, `get-section.sh`, `validate-structure.sh`, `update-progress.sh` - Utilities
  - See `scripts/README.md` for full documentation
- `BASH_HELPERS.md` - Design rationale and usage examples

## Current State

**Using:** Trainset Lite (manual workflow management)  
**Building:** Trainset Full (CLI automation with Python)  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Design Architecture Components

## Key Principle

**DO NOT write Python code until Phase 1 gate passes!**

The first implementation attempt suffered from "vibe-coding" - making architectural decisions incrementally without structured planning. This rebuild applies Trainset's own principles to prevent that problem.

## Workflow Summary

### Phase 1: Design Architecture Components
Create all design artifacts before any code: template library, document schemas, decomposed examples, file organization.

**Gate:** All design artifacts complete and internally consistent.

### Phase 2: Implement CLI Scaffolding
Build TOML parser, entity validator, placeholder generator, structure validator.

**Gate:** Can parse workflow.toml and generate schema-compliant placeholder files.

### Phase 3: Implement State Management
Build StateManager, Tree/Node classes, status command, new command.

**Gate:** Can track state, read hierarchy, report accurate status.

### Phase 4: Implement Gate Execution
Build GateValidator, validate command, next-phase command, DFS traversal.

**Gate:** Can execute gates and advance phases with proper DFS handling.

### Phase 5: Integration Testing
LLM integration, agent command generation, comprehensive testing, documentation.

**Gate:** Can complete full workflow from interview to working project with LLM.

## Installation in New Project

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Copy Trainset Lite to your project
cp -r path/to/trainset/.trainset your-project/.trainset

# 2. Copy commands to your AI platform
# For OpenCode:
cp -r .trainset/commands/system .opencode/command/
# For Claude Code:
cp -r .trainset/commands/system .claude/commands/

# 3. Restart your AI CLI to load commands

# 4. Run setup
/setup
```

```

## How to Use

### View Current Status

**With bash helper (recommended):**
```bash
bash .trainset/scripts/status.sh
```

**Manual:**
```bash
cat .trainset/PROGRESS.md
```

### Update Progress (Manual)

Edit PROGRESS.md:
- Check off completed items: `- [x] Item done`
- Leave unchecked: `- [ ] Item pending`
- Update notes section

### Validate Gate

**With bash helper:**
```bash
bash .trainset/scripts/validate-gate.sh
```

**Manual:** Review checklist in PROGRESS.md

### For AI Assistants

Use slash commands in `.opencode/command/`:
- `/status` - Show current progress (uses bash helper)
- `/advance` - Move to next phase (checks gate)
- `/gate-check` - Assess readiness
- `/context` - Show project details

Slash commands can use bash helpers for efficient data extraction.

## Meta-Approach

We're using Trainset Lite to build Trainset Full - proving the concept works by using it on itself. This is the ultimate validation: can Trainset build Trainset?

If yes, the architecture works. If no, we learn what needs fixing.
