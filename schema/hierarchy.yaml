  # Learning: singular: "lesson", plural: "lessons", directory: "lessons"
  # Documentation: singular: "section", plural: "sections", directory: "sections"

default_workflow: "feature-workflow"

# Available workflows
# List of workflow templates available for use

# Notes:
# - This file is created during /setup by the AI interviewer
# - The terminology fields affect slash command names and prompts
# - The directory field determines where work items are stored (.trainset/stories/ or .trainset/tasks/, etc.)
# - Multiple workflows allow different processes for different work types
# - This structure is compatible with Trainset Full for easy migration
